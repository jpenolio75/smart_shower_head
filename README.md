# Smart Shower Head

Smart objects are just about everywhere, improving our daily lives. However, there are not really any products out there that make our shower smart. That is where the idea for the Smart Shower Head came in. When taking a shower, since all water must flow through your shower head to get to you, it makes sense to make the shower head a smart device by tracking your water usage as you shower, display that information to you in real time through a LCD screen, and have the capability to store that information elsewhere. By using these statistics, a user can be aware and track their overall water usage, costs, and overall impact and hopefully reduce water usage, save money, and help protect the environment. However, that alone may not be enough for some people. That is why we also decided to make our Smart Shower Head not just a water awareness device, but a useful and fun gadget as well, to encourage more people to use it and conserve
